To run this successfully
- we replaced the pip folder with the latest version of pip so as to install all the required dependencies
after running the command of `firebase init functions` so we did that to fix initia errors
- later on the IDE cudn't recognize the imported packages in the `main.py` file and to fix this error,
we has to run `E:\Cephas Python\cloud_functions_test\functions` in administrator mode terminal, so now all is set so far
